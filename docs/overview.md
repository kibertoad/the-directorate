# The Directorate

## Summary

Main game loop consists of reacting to plots and uncovering clandestine operations. Player is put in charge of a covert group documented as Section 11 (in-game alias to be chosen by player) which reports to the Directorate.
The Directorate answers to no country, political or religious power, and is concerned with maintaining the pure power as such. Therefore your areas of interest, as well as allies and adversaries will keep changing through the game.

## Resources

Your main resource is agents, whom you can send across the world on a variety of missions, such as investigation, assassination, extraction and infiltration.

Additional resources that you employ are decryption, wiretapping and medical teams.

You can wiretap select individuals, but beyond certain amount of time there is an ever growing risk of tap being detected.
You can decrypt intercepted or recovered messages. Decrypting every message makes further decryption for same organization easier, until it changes the code.

When you are successful in pursuing the agenda of the Directorate, you get influence points which you can spend on
obtaining more resources or setting up locations across the world (safehouses, laboratories etc)

You have cash which you can use for transactions with minor players.

Weapon and poisons are illegal and you need to either smuggle them together with your agent, or obtain locally.
Certain agent perks allow to insta-succeed at smuggling items under fixed level of heat.

## Agents

Agents have perks, skills and personality traits.
For an example, they can be either confident (faster planning, greater chance of success) or cautious (chance to bail early when mission is failed, leading to no negative consequences)

It is hard, but not impossible to get agents killed. Under usual circumstances they get captured and you can extract them.

When agents are executed, you get a black dot on the perpetrator. Until vengeance strike is dealt, your agents suffer
penalty to their loyalty, which affects their performance, especially resilience to interrogation.

## Missions

Missions generate heat. Your organization has regional heat, while your agents have worldwide heat. Heat makes all
operations slower, harder and more expensive.

## Plots

Plots are defined as certain pipelines. You can foil a plot by making certain steps impossible. If there is no plan b nor replacement executor available, plot stops, and all remaining conspirators go into the hiding.
Amount of influence that you get is based on the highest-ranked conspirator that you managed to extract as well as the amount of information that you accumulated about higher-tier plotting organization.
If plot is successful, you lose influence.

## Organizations

There are two types of organizations: major players and minor players. Major players have their agendas and operate worldwide. They can be organizing plots against you as well as running their clandestine operations.
Minor players operate in a single country, and can be enlisted both by major players and by you to assist with their operations.

By doing something for minor players, you accumulate favours with them. By wronging them, you get grudges.
Organizations keep neither favours, nor grudges, but their leaders do. Keep that in mind when deciding whether they need to stay.

## End game

Ultimately player is tasked with eliminating the Chess Master, who is organizing the most high-impact operation against the Directorate, operating through several layers of proxy organizations.
